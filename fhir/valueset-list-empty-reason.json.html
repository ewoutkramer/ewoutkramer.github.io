Example uses:&lt;br/&gt; * For allergies: the patient or patient's agent/guardian has asserted that he/she is not aware of any allergies (NKA - nil known allergies)&lt;br/&gt; * For medications: the patient or patient's agent/guardian has asserted that the patient is known to be taking no medications&lt;br/&gt; * For diagnoses, problems and procedures: the patient or patient's agent/guardian has asserted that there is no known event to record.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other language is sometimes used for this concept, such as 'no significant [x] known'.&lt;br/&gt;SNOMED CT includes many codes for this general concept, but no single generalisation. If using SNOMED CT, use this code and the appropriate specific SNOMED CT code&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;notasked&lt;a name=\&quot;notasked\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not Asked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;THe investigation to find out whether there are items for this list has not occurred&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;withheld&lt;a name=\&quot;withheld\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Information Withheld&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Information was not provided due to privacy or confidentiality concerns.
