It is also used for prescribing and dispensing devices for patient use. If the device is implanted in a patient, then the patient element will be present, and there would be no location. \r\n\r\nDevices that are implanted in a patient differ from medications because they are not \&quot;used up\&quot; - they remain active in a patient in an ongoing fashion. The Medication resource SHOULD not be used to represent implanted devices.&quot;,
