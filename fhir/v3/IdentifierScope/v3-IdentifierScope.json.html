The identifier SHALL change with each state transition on the object. I.e. The version identifier of an object prior to a 'suspend' state transition is distinct from the identifier of the object after the state transition. Each version identifier can be tied to exactly one ControlAct event which brought that version into being (though the control act may never be instantiated).&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                            NOTE: Applications that do not support versioning of objects must ignore and not persist these ids to avoid confusion resulting from leaving the same identifier on an object that undergoes changes. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;VW&lt;a name=\&quot;VW\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;View Specific Identifier&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        \n                           Description: An identifier that references a particular object as it existed at a given point in time.
